This is a simple implementation of Socket.io with the use case of a chat app.
When users connect and disconnect, this is displayed on other users browser.
And chat messages can be broadcasted to all connected users.

Intallation:

1. clone this project

2. run `npm run devStart`

3. run LiveServer

4. and open multiple browser windows to test the chat functionality

In further implementations I will host this on a server so it can be run on the web.
