This is a simple implementation of Socket.io with the use case of a chat app.
When users connect and disconnect, this is displayed on other users browser.
And chat messages can be broadcasted to all connected users.

Intallation: Simply clone this project, run LiveServer, and open multiple windows with this running to test.
In further implementations I will host this on a server so it can be run on the web.
